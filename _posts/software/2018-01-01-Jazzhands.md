    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A base application for AR and VR that makes it possible so the user can use their hands to interact with objects inside of the virtual world. No need for expensive controllers of the HTV Vive or Oculus Rift, but just your own hands.</p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>We would like to offer an easy to use library for developers to use in their applications. Jazzhands will allow users to use their hands as controllers in VR & AR applications on their phones. Our vision is to create a market for users who do not have the money for expensive VR & AR systems, but do want to experience what it is like to use those systems. Building on cheap solutions like the Google Cardboard we offer additional functionality to use your hands in the applications you use.</p>
